Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price
of real estate properties based on various features like location, size, number of
rooms, amenities, and more.

Features:
• Data Collection: Use a dataset containing historical real estate data,
  including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location (zip
  code, neighborhood), property age, and nearby amenities.
• Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding
  categorical variables (like neighborhood names), and normalizing numerical
  features.
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the relationships between different
  features and the target variable (price) using visualizations like scatter plots,
  heatmaps, and bar charts.
• Feature Engineering: Create new features like price per square foot,
  distance to city center, or proximity to public transportation to improve
  model accuracy.
• Modeling: Implement regression algorithms such as Linear Regression,
  Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict property
  prices.
• Model Evaluation: Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE
  (Mean Absolute Error), and R² score to evaluate model performance.
• Deployment: Create a web application using Flask or Django where users
  can input property details and get a price estimate.
